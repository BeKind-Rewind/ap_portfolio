                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Budding Coder, Professional Coach, Athlete, Musician, Artist. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up as a poor, nerdy, youngest-sibling of 4 without many friends in the mid-west. I 
                    had no expectations of gradure but found ways to put my curiousity and creativity to work: 
                    I learned to entertain myself finding solace in drawing, music, constructing, and video 
                    games. As early as 5-years-old (mid-80's), time with Dad often involved playing games on 
                    his work computer, the Commadore-64, experimenting with the command line code, and discovering 
                    why sticking magnets to the hard-drive was a "no-no." The interaction with the computer was
                    an especially novel treat. No one had home computers at that time and we certainly couldn't 
                    have afforded anything like that! Every minute I was allowed to interact with it, or even watch 
                    my dad work through problems, was like a visit to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. 
                </p>

                    <h2>More..</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've always had a great curiosity for learning, especially how to "make something myself,"
                        which would at the end of the day allow me to help others. When it came time to decide 
                        a college major, it was a tough choice but as an artist and musician I had decided to 
                        further my skills and understanding, graduating cum-laude in 2006 from The Ohio State 
                        with a focus in Horn and vocals.  At the same time, I walked-on the OSU's varsity rowing 
                        program and had such a fundamentally enlightening experience, it sparked my passion for 
                        learning and teaching the sport to others. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        I have been coaching rowing since 2006 with great successes, earning 2 NCAA national 
                        championships at the Division-1 level. For the last 5 years, I have been building up
                        youth athletes to enjoy competitive careers and further be recruited to dream colleges
                        of their chosing. 
                    </p> 
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        While it may at first glance appear these aspects of my life are very different, I have
                        grown to know how much they overlap and support each other. There is art, music, passion,
                        learning, constructing, de-constructing, playing, and teaching to found in each. And this
                        is what I bring with me into the coding world. Pull back the curtain: let's figure out the
                        "magic" and change the world. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        I have always found that "we don't rise to our goals; rather, we settle to our 
                        level of work we're willing to put in;" that "hard work beats talent, when talent 
                        doesn't work hard;" and that "keeping it simple" holds true in every situation.
