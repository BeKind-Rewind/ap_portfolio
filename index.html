                          My parents are my inspiration. I grew up as a poor, nerdy, youngest-sibling of 4 without many 
                          friends in the mid-west. I had no expectations of gradure but found ways to put my curiousity 
                          and creativity to work: I learned to entertain myself finding solace in drawing, music, constructing, and video 
                          games. As early as 5-years-old (mid-80's), time with Dad often involved playing games on 
                          his work computer, the Commadore-64, experimenting with the command line code, and discovering 
                          why sticking magnets to the hard-drive was a "no-no." The interaction with the computer was
                          an especially novel treat. No one had home computers at that time and we certainly couldn't 
                          have afforded anything like that! Every minute I was allowed to interact with it, or even watch 
                          my dad work through problems, was like a visit to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory.

                          Rowing Coach: I have been coaching rowing since 2006 with great successes, earning 2 NCAA 
                          Division-1 national championship titles for Brown University and University of Virginia. 
                          I met my husband, also a career, competitive D-1 rowing coach and made the life-decision 
                          to get married and move to Dallas to coach youth.
